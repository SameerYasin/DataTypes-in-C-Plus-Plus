Aim: To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

Software Required: Visual Studio Code

Theory:
In C++, data types define what kind of data a variable can hold. When a variable is declared, the compiler allocates a specific amount of memory based on the data type, as different data types require different amounts of memory. C++ offers a wide range of data types, and it’s up to the programmer to choose the most suitable one for the program’s needs.

Character Data Type (char): The `char` data type is used to store a single character. It occupies 1 byte of memory and stores characters enclosed in single quotes (`' '`). It can hold up to 256 different characters, based on their ASCII values.

Integer Data Type (int): The `int` data type is used for storing integer numbers. It occupies 4 bytes of memory (on 64-bit systems) and can store numbers in various numeral systems like binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. The range of values it can store is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

Boolean Data Type (bool): The `bool` data type stores logical values, either true (1) or false (0). It takes up 1 byte of memory.

Floating Point Data Type (float): The `float` data type is used to store numbers that have a decimal point. It takes 4 bytes of memory (on 64-bit systems) and can store values in the range of 1.2e-38 to 3.4e+38.

Double Data Type (double): The `double` data type is used for storing decimal numbers with higher precision than `float`. It occupies 8 bytes of memory (on 64-bit systems) and can store values in the range of 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308.

Implementation:
In this program, I asked the user to input values for different data types and then displayed the type and size of each data type.

To run this code, copy the code into Visual Studio Code and execute the program.

Conclusion:
Through this practical, I learned about the different data types available in C++. I understood how the size of each data type varies and how to use each data type based on the requirements of the program.
